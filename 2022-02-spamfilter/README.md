# Spam four ways: A guided tour of approaches to classify text data

Nicholas J. Horton, Jie Chao, William Finzer, and Phebe Palmer

The world is full of data, and much of it is unstructured. An example is text data, which forms a critical part of our lives through books, magazines, and the internet. Surprisingly, despite the key role that language arts play in all aspects of education, text analysis has traditionally not played a major part in statistics education.

While there are many interesting literary analyses that one might consider, we explore a more mundane but familiar example by exploring when a text string taken from an email subject line is spam (an unwanted or inappropriate email message).

The column describes four different ways to provide students with experiences classifying text as data by exploring spam.
