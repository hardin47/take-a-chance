    "Beyond initial thoughts, statistical tchotchkes, and Google searches, it’s important to reflect on who else has made important contributions to statistics. Blatantly missing from the Google search is David Blackwell, a giant in the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "## David Blackwell\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguably, the most famous/influential/brilliant African American statistician is David Blackwell. Statisticians may know Blackwell from the Rao-Blackwell theorem which says that after conditioning on a sufficient statistic, the new estimator will have smaller (or equal to) mean squared error than the original estimator. Indeed, the Rao-Blackwell theorem is seen in most undergraduate Statistical Theory textbooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blackwell was the 1st African American elected to the National Academies of Science and the 1st African American tenured at UC Berkeley. He was the 7th African American to receive a PhD in mathematics. In 2012, President Obama posthumously awarded Blackwell the National Medal of Science.\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of Blackwell’s career in statistics was spent at UC Berkeley (1954-1988). However, his start at UC Berkeley was postponed due to racism in the Department of Mathematics. The story is that the chair of the department (Erich Lehmann) wanted to hire Blackwell in 1942. However, the wife of another faculty member didn’t want any Black members of the department because then she wouldn’t feel comfortable hosting department events in her home. So the wife told her husband to tell Lehmann not to hire Blackwell. Which is what happened. You can hear Blackwell describe the situation in his own words at *www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqpf9tw44Xw*. It is a powerful three minute video; I recommend you watch it and show it to your students.\n",
    "\n",
    "I recount the Blackwell story to indicate that racism is critical and recent in the history of statistics. Indeed, see Bodmer et al. (2021) for a detailed description of the eugenics movement associated with R.A. Fisher and colleagues. But even more salient is notion that in the standard undergraduate curriculum, there are very few people of color who our students see as role models.\n",

    "> Research indicates that many young people may be deterred from pursuing STEM fields due to prominent stereotypes regarding who best fits and belongs in such fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the reasons that representation impacts participation in engaging in STEM include stereotypes about innate abilities and stereotypes about images in the field. The first set of stereotypes (innate abilities) describe beliefs that particular groups are not **capable** of success in STEM fields. The second set of stereotypes (images) describe beliefs that particular groups do not **belong** to STEM fields. Regardless, it seems clear that if students can see themselves in the scholars of the field, they will be more likely to continue pursuing that discipline.\n",

    "Buckmire et al. (2023) write on what makes a “mathematician.” They recognize that narrowly defining who should / can do mathematics is a process by which people are made to feel excluded from mathematics. In their article they present a variety of definitions for “mathematician”, and each of the nine co-authors describes how they do or do not meet each of the definitions. The different representations show students a diversity of role models.\n",

    "Our students’ identities span the entire spectrum of backgrounds. Just like us, they are diverse with respect to race, socio-economic background, gender identity, faith, and ability. As educators, the more we can cultivate sense of belonging in our statistics or data science classroom, the more successful we will be at communicating our learning outcomes.

    "# CURV - connecting, uplifting, and recognizing voices\n",
    "\n",
    "To combat the homogeneity of representation in standard statistics content, in most of my courses, I’ve introduced a weekly activity of *Statistician of the Day*. The scholars who I present are those traditionally underrepresented in statistics and data science. Many of them are people of color, but they also represent individuals who are pushing boundaries to make statistics and data science more accessible and inclusive, often because they themselves have navigated a world which was not accessible or not inclusive.\n",

He has dozens of online courses through the edX platform and over a hundred publications via Google scholar.\n",

    "Relevant to the CURV database however is the work that Rafael Irizarry has done in Puerto Rico. Having graduated from the University of Puerto Rico, Professor Irizarry had a vested interest in the community that was ravaged in 2017 when Hurricane Maria, a category 5 hurricane, devastated the island. With collaborators, Professor Irizarry performed a representative stratified sample to measure neighborhoods based on how easily accessible they were in the aftermath of the hurricane.\n",

    "The original news reports, months after the hurricane, were that the official death report from Hurricane Maria was 64 people. Professor Irizarry and colleagues estimated that the number of excess deaths was 4645, with a 95% confidence interval of 793 to 8498.\n",

Once a week (or sometimes at every class period), I briefly introduce a scholar and present different ways they have contributed to the field. Typically, I use only about five minutes of class time. Some scholars illicit discussion, but for most of them, I simply present their background and work, and we move on to the course material of the day.\n",
