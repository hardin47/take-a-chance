## Idea

I've got an idea for a "Taking a Chance in the Classroom" article that builds on prior work that Joan Garfield and colleagues did with their Model Eliciting Activity for their CATALST project (see https://serc.carleton.edu/sp/cause/mea/examples/example3.html).  

The original MEA provides students with lists of subject lines from email that Joan classified as "spam" or "not spam".  In groups, they need to determine a "rule" to classify the subject lines and then implement it for their examples.  They are then given another set of messages (test data) and asked to apply their rule.  There are a lot of neat aspects of this activity and I've used it successfully for many years in intro stats.  But there's no technology.  

My idea for "Taking a Chance in the Classroom" would be to describe an extension that I've developed where students implement their rules using CODAP and R.  For example, they might decide that a message that is in all caps or a message that has repeated punctuation marks is likely to be spam. Or messages with a set of protective words (e.g., "Duke University") might be marked as non-spam.   I've been giving them a set of such rules that they can mix and match.

Deb Nolan and Duncan Temple Lang had spam filtering as one of their case studies in "Data Science with R" and this is relevant (though for Deb and Duncan they had considerably more meta data available beyond the subject lines).
